## Joining datasets
```{r}
d1 <- merge(BBM_Entrance_Survey, BBM_Exit_Survey, by = c("NHINO", "Cohort Group"), all = T)
d2 <- merge(d1, BBM_Health_Coach, by = c("NHINO", "Cohort Group"), all = T)
d3 <- merge(d2, BBM_Templates, by = c("NHINO", "Cohort Group"), all = T)
d4 <- merge(d3, BBM_CVD_Risk_Halcyon, by = c("NHINO", "Cohort Group"), all = T)
fulldata_withoutweeklyweights <- merge(d4, BBM_Summary, by = c("NHINO", "Cohort Group"), all = T)

Fulldata <- merge(d5, BBM_Weekly_Weights, all = T)

Fulldata$`Cohort Group` <- as.factor(Fulldata$`Cohort Group`)
```

## reordering cohort group column
```{r}
library(dplyr)

Fulldata <- Fulldata %>% arrange(`Cohort Group`)

fulldata_withoutweeklyweights <- fulldata_withoutweeklyweights %>%
        arrange(`Cohort Group`)

```

## Writing completed dataset to CSV
```{r}
write.csv(Fulldata, file = "BBM_Merged_Draft_Data_W_Weeklyweights.csv", row.names = F)
write.csv(fulldata_withoutweeklyweights, file = "BBM_Merged_Draft_Data_without_Weeklyweights.csv", row.names = F)
```


## ANALYSIS USING MERGED DATA
##________________________________________________________________________________________
```{r}
BBM_Merged$`Cohort Group` <- as.factor(BBM_Merged$`Cohort Group`)
```

## Common demoninators across cohorts in weekly weights
## Focus anly analysis that uses weekly weights using
## Week 1 / 6 / 12 across cohorts 2 and 3
